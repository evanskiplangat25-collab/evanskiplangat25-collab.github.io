Whether I''m crafting pixel-perfect UIs or writing clean Vue.js/Nuxt.js code, my focus is always on creating value for the end-user.\n\n### What Drives Me\n\nWhat keeps me excited about this work is the constant learning and the challenge of translating complex ideas into simple, elegant solutions. There''s nothing more rewarding than seeing a design come to life and knowing it''s making someone''s digital interaction easier or more enjoyable.\n\n### Beyond the Screen\n\nWhen I''m not designing or coding, you might find me exploring Boston''s latest coffee shops, hiking nearby trails, or occasionally contributing to open-source projects.\n\nThanks for stopping by. Feel free to browse my [projects](/projects) or [get in touch](/#contact) if you''d like to collaborate!\n"', 'Learn more about my journey as a Boston-based UX/UI Designer & Front-End Developer, my design philosophy, and my passion for crafting intuitive digital experiences.', 'yml', '[{"src":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1744877478622-a78c7a3336f6?q=80&w=1587&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D","alt":"My coffee workspace"},{"src":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1744429523595-2c06b8611242?q=80&w=1587&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D","alt":"My trip to Tokyo"}]', '{}', 'true', '/about', '{"title":"About Me","description":"Learn more about my journey as a Boston-based UX/UI Designer & Front-End Developer, my design philosophy, and my passion for crafting intuitive digital experiences."}', 'about', 'bdXwa6ZXg7s9ektjt12i_vJ5VgQ8lzGcCcuUWVBF4ZI'); -- bdXwa6ZXg7s9ektjt12i_vJ5VgQ8lzGcCcuUWVBF4ZI
